# bing-DDG
TamperMonkey / GreaseMonkey / ViolentMonkey script to redirect Bing searches from the windows menu to Duck Duck Go

Works best with EdgeDeflector installed. Then to search with the search engine that doesn't spy on you all you need to do is hit the windows key and type away. You can even use !bang searches.
